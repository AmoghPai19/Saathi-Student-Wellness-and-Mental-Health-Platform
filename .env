# Example environment variables for the frontend
# Vite exposes env vars that start with VITE_. If you use plain REACT_BASE_URL it
# may not be available in the Vite-built client unless you expose it. To be
# compatible, set one of the following.

# Preferred (Vite):
VITE_REACT_BASE_URL="https://saathi-student-wellness-and-mental-two.vercel.app"

# Alternate (non-prefixed). Note: Vite will not expose this by default. Use
# only if you have a custom setup to expose it to the client runtime.
REACT_BASE_URL="https://saathi-student-wellness-and-mental-two.vercel.app"

# n8n webhook URL used by ChatSupport (optional)
VITE_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL="https://sumanth23.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/a73b7815-198a-4378-b036-61500647dffd/chat"
